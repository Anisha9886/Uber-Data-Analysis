# Uber-Data-Analysis
The Uber Ride Analysis project was a fascinating look into how and when people use Uber the most! 🚗💨 I discovered the top reasons people book rides, whether it’s for work, errands, or leisure. The analysis revealed peak booking times—hint: people love to book rides during rush hours! ⏰ I also found out which months have fewer bookings (surprisingly, rides dip during certain seasons!) and uncovered the average miles people travel per trip. It was exciting to see how patterns in ride bookings reflect people’s daily routines and travel habits, offering valuable insights that can help Uber optimize its services. 🚀
